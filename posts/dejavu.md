## Echoes on the Road

The house is still. My mind? Not so much.  
So I’m here, writing—trying to get this moment out of my head and onto the page.

---

A few days ago, I got *that* phone call.

She’d flown back to help a friend recover from surgery.  
She’s eighteen now—officially an adult, out there navigating the world, building her own map. I’m proud of her for that.

Then came the news:  
She’d passed out.  
They brought her down to the ER.

I didn’t know much else.  
Just enough to grab my keys and head to the hospital.

---

I wasn’t panicking.  
I wasn’t speeding or playing mental worst-case-scenario bingo.

I was just going—calmly—because that’s what you do.  
Not to fix it, but to be there.  
Because sometimes just *being there* is the most underrated superpower.

Hospitals are confusing.  
Even more so when you’re the patient and not the provider.  
Machines beeping, people talking in acronyms, and everything smells like antiseptic and mystery.

I’ve lived in that world.  
So I showed up. Quiet. Steady.  
Letting her know:

> *“You’re not alone in this.  
I’ve walked this path before—if you need a guide, I’ve got you.”*

---

And somewhere on the drive, I had one of those *déjà vu* moments.

Not spooky. Not dreamlike.  
More like… “Huh. Haven’t we done this already?”

---

The road I was on had only been open a few months, but in that instant, it felt familiar.  
Like I’d driven it for *this exact reason* a dozen times.

Not in distance.  
But in purpose.

Because if you’re a parent, you know this loop:  
You see your kid stepping into something new, a little unsteady, and you show up.  
Not to lead. Not to lecture.  
Just to let them know someone solid is nearby.

---

She didn’t need medical advice.  
She didn’t need a rescue.

She needed a steady presence.  
Someone whose heartbeat wasn’t climbing.  
Someone who could say, even without saying much:

> *“You’re good. I’m here. Let’s figure it out together.”*

---

Later, we found out it was low blood sugar.  
She just hadn’t eaten that day. Rookie mistake.  
Cue the classic “Please eat something next time” talk—but gently, because we’ve all been there.

---

But that feeling in the car stuck with me.  
That quick, vivid flash of familiarity.  
Like the moment already knew me before I fully showed up to it.

I think that’s the real story.  
Not what happened at the hospital.  
But how I got to be there—not panicked, not controlling, just *present.*

---

I’m still wide awake.  
But the moment’s out of my head and onto the page.  
And that’s good enough for now.
