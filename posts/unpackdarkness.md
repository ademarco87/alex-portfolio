## 🧳 The Weight I Didn’t Know I Was Carrying

I haven’t left EMS yet. Not fully.

But I’ve started making different choices—the kind I used to see as weakness.  
The kind that say, *“I’ve carried this long enough.”*

I’m not quitting. I’m unburdening.  
Peeling back years of survival mode, one layer at a time.

I used to think you had to stay in the fire to prove your worth.  
Now I know: sometimes strength looks like stepping out long enough to breathe.

## 🩺 The Job Became My Armor

For years, the job explained away everything. My temper. My numbness. The silence in my head after a bad call.

It gave me purpose, sure—but it also gave me excuses.  
I didn’t realize how far I’d slipped until I stopped moving long enough to feel the damage.

And yeah, I’m good at it. That only made it harder to question if I should keep doing it.

Because when you're good at saving others, it’s easy to ignore the part of you that’s quietly bleeding out.

## 💻 Healing Didn’t Look Like Therapy. It Looked Like Building Something Else.

You want to know what healing *actually* looked like for me?

It looked like debugging a backend API at 2am because I couldn’t shut my brain off.  
It looked like building a tool from scratch just to prove I still could.  
It looked like writing logic that didn’t lie to me.  
Systems that didn’t scream. Inputs that didn’t die in my hands.

Learning to code gave me something EMS never could—**boundaries**.  
Structure. Predictability. Room to rebuild, without bracing for another loss.

I wasn’t just coding. I was reclaiming my bandwidth.

## 🪖 From the Warzone to the Box

It didn’t start in EMS. It started in war.

The uniform changed, but the mission didn’t: stabilize what’s broken. Absorb the damage. Keep going.

I went from firefights to flatlines. From combat zones to cardiac arrests.

And I *kept running*. Never slowing. Never breathing.

Code didn’t save me. But it made me slow down.  
It gave me a way to create without bleeding. To think without unraveling.

## 🚫 I’m Not Trying to Forget

I’m not running from the ones I couldn’t save.  
I’m not ashamed of the uniforms I’ve worn or the scars they left.

But I *am* done pretending that carrying it all without flinching is some kind of badge of honor.

I’m done glorifying burnout.  
Done confusing survival for strength.  
Done pretending I’m fine when I’m very clearly not.

## 🛠️ Choosing to Rebuild (While Still in the Fire)

This isn’t the dramatic exit. Not yet.

This is the *pause*. The breath between tones. The decision to build a way out before I burn out for good.

I’m still showing up for the calls—but I’m also showing up for myself.

I want to be a father who’s *present* when he gets home.  
A husband who doesn’t have to shut down just to feel safe.  
A man who can still see himself in the mirror.

## 🕊️ Healing is the Harder Choice

There’s no field guide for this. No medal. No dispatch code for emotional triage.

Just the slow, quiet work of unpacking years of buried pain—while the tones still drop.

If you’re still out there—tired, numb, grinding through it—I need you to know something:

You don’t owe anyone your suffering.

You’re allowed to start healing, even if you’re not out yet.

I did.

And for the first time in a long time—I’m starting to breathe again.
