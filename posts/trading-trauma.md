## 🧍 The Making of a Soldier

I wasn’t some fresh-faced 18-year-old looking for a thrill. I was 22. A husband. A father of two. A man who had already tasted failure and was willing to fight like hell for something better.

We packed everything we owned into a beat-up truck and moved across the country to Oklahoma. I’d been promised a job—a lifeline. A way to build stability for my family. I spent our last dollar chasing that hope.

And then the rug got pulled. The job was gone. No warning. No backup plan. Just rejection and the crushing weight of having to look my wife and kids in the eye and pretend everything was okay.

I didn’t have the luxury of sulking. I had to adapt.

I was raised by my grandfather, a man who taught me to lead, to carry weight that wasn’t mine, and to hold my word like a blade. My mother always said I’d serve one day. She knew.

I grew up without my biological father, but my grandfather raised me as his own — and from him, I learned what it meant to be honorable. To step up when no one else would.

Somewhere deep down, I believed that to become a man, you had to earn it — through duty, through sacrifice, through action.

> “Come back with your shield, or on it.”

It’s a line made famous in *300*, sure. But that mindset? It’s older than history. It wasn’t a motto — it was a promise.

It was 2010, at the height of the war—the Surge. I wasn’t naive. I knew what I was signing up for. I knew I could go to war. And I still signed. Because I believed in something bigger than me. I wanted to serve. I wanted to fight for something real.

My first unit was a Forward Aid Station (FAS), a Role 1 unit stationed out of Germany. We trained for mass casualty scenarios and lived in a constant state of readiness. My wife was with me at the time, but we were young and not built to last. No fights. No bad blood. Just a quiet split — and she returned home to the States.

Eventually, I reenlisted for a unit out of Fort Hood that was already on the docket to deploy. I wanted to deploy. I wanted to do something meaningful—something I had trained to do. I was still that boy who believed the rite of passage to becoming a man was earned in blood and brotherhood.

And I did.

## 🪖 War, Brotherhood, and the First Wound

My first deployment came in 2014–2015. I was a platoon medic embedded with a team of infantrymen who quickly became more than brothers—they were everything.

That’s where I learned what brotherhood really was.

It’s not about shared laughs or common interests. It’s deeper. Primal.  
Brotherhood is when a man willingly places himself in front of danger—not for glory, but for the guy beside him.

I was treating a junior soldier mid-firefight—his gear was too tight, and he couldn’t breathe. We were already in the funnel, the whole platoon packed into that narrow alley, exposed.

While I was helping him, my First Sergeant stepped in front of me—shielding me with his own body.

No words. No orders. Just action.

He outranked me. He didn’t have to do it. But he did.

In that split second, he made it clear: I mattered.

That’s brotherhood. Silent. Immediate. Real.

I’ve never forgotten that feeling.
Real leadership doesn’t shout. It steps in front of the bullet.

I patched holes while bullets cracked past my head. I stopped the bleeding while calling in medevacs that sometimes didn’t arrive. I held the hands of men while they bled out and lied to them with a calm voice I didn’t feel:  
> *"You’re going to be alright."*

But one moment never left me.

We were on patrol, supporting ANA forces, when we cleared a house perched on a hill. We found a three-year-old boy who had been dipped in boiling water — tortured for information. The parents said it was an accident, but the burn pattern was deliberate. Equal. Intentional. I knew evil when I saw it.

I treated the child as best I could, wrapped him gently in gauze, trying to protect what little skin he had left. And then — minutes later — the world ignited.

A complex attack. A three-hour firefight. Multiple RPGs. A PKM tearing through the air. Chaos.

I didn’t even realize three hours had passed until I checked my watch. Adrenaline didn’t rush — rage did.  
That was the first time I saw true evil. And that rage? It lingered for years.

We killed 24 of them that day. My platoon had 24 men total.  
Let that sink in. We stood alone, outnumbered, and walked away without a scratch.

Taliban started calling our unit, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, “Hell on Wheels” — because our patch looked like a tire from a distance.  
We didn’t back down. We rolled through.

My second deployment came in 2016–2017. I was the senior company medic. I trained new medics, managed supplies, made command decisions under fire. But my body… was failing me.

Between deployments, I’d sustained an injury. I pushed through. I adapted. But I wasn’t the same.

And eventually, I knew I couldn’t keep going.

I was no longer fit to continue fighting in the Global War on Terrorism. I got out on my terms. Not because I was broken, but because I refused to risk becoming the weak link. The men I served with deserved better.

I left with my head high — but the war came home with me.

## 🚑 The War Didn’t End — It Changed Uniforms

EMS was the natural shift. Trauma was second nature by then.  
I became a paramedic, earned my card, and threw myself into the chaos. But something was off.

The adrenaline? It never came.  
I was chasing a high I could no longer reach. The edge I used to feel was gone. The rage, however, was still there — hiding in plain sight.

Then COVID hit.

24-hour shifts became 48 with 24 off. Call after call. PPE soaked in sweat. Patients dying alone.  
I held hands through gloves and hoped it was enough.

But every tone-out started making my skin crawl. I’d lay down on my days off and still hear them — imaginary calls echoing through silence. I couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t rest. I was restless, agitated, detached. That rage started bleeding into my family life. My empathy began to decay.

The invisible wound that started in war kept reopening in EMS. Therapy helped me cope — but it didn’t heal.  
It kept me from unraveling completely, but it couldn’t erase what had already fused into my wiring.

## ⌨️ Coding My Way Out

I didn’t fall in love with coding. I reached for it like a lifeline.

Software gave me something no firefight, no ambulance, no trauma ever could: **peace**.

It gave me structure. Focus. Silence.

I enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University. No handouts. No breaks.  
Just 2 a.m. coding sessions between shifts, five daughters climbing on my back, and a mind that refused to quit.

I studied code to quiet a mind that wouldn’t stop spinning. And little by little, I began to rebuild.

I didn’t just learn to code. I weaponized it.

This wasn’t reinvention. It was **reclamation**.

## 🩺 The Job Had Become My Armor

EMS gave me purpose, but it also gave me excuses. I didn’t realize how deep I’d sunk until I decided to stop.

That whole unraveling? I wrote about it in more detail [here](/post/unpacking-darkness).

## ⚒️ Built for Chaos, Wired to Build

I’m not the kind of guy who dresses up in a suit and says “yes boss” to whatever you throw at me. I’m not fake. I’m not corporate.  
I’m real, grounded, and direct. If you challenge me, I’ll challenge you back. That’s how progress works.

I’ve triaged mass casualty scenes.  
I’ve cracked ribs during CPR on children.  
I’ve made life-or-death decisions with no time, no backup, and no room for error.

So no — I don’t panic when a build fails.  
I don’t freeze when an API crashes.  
I don’t flinch when the pressure hits. I execute.

Code is just another system to stabilize. Another life to reclaim.

I don’t want a job. I want a mission.

If you need someone who thrives in pressure and refuses to quit — you’ve already found him.

**I’m Alexander DeMarco.**  
Combat medic. Paramedic. Father. Fighter.  
Now — a software developer.

Let’s build something that doesn’t break when it matters most.
