## 🔐 Credentials Revoked

There was a day I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the guy staring back.

Not because of the uniform.  
But because I had no idea who I was *without* it.

I’d spent years authenticating as “the medic,” “the fixer,” “the one who keeps going.”  
And suddenly? Credentials expired. Identity: not found.

## 🚷 Logging Into Someone Else’s Life

Leaving EMS doesn’t just change your job — it rewrites your entire access control list.

Your phone stops ringing.  
People stop needing you every minute.  
Your purpose, your chaos, your adrenaline-fueled coping mechanisms?  
All deprecated.

I was logging into a life I didn’t recognize.  
No username. No password.  
Just static. Silence. And a locked-out feeling I couldn’t explain.

## 🖥️ Code Didn’t Judge Me

I didn’t turn to code because I wanted a new career.

I turned to code because it was the first place I didn’t have to prove I was okay.

No one asked why I left.  
No one looked disappointed.  
If I messed up, the compiler yelled at me — and *then* gave me the tools to fix it.

Coding gave me authentication through action.  
Every bug I fixed was a tiny recovery of trust — in myself.

## 🧠 Who Even Am I?

Honestly? I’m still figuring it out.

But now I know this:

- I’m more than a badge.
- I’m allowed to exist outside a crisis.
- I don’t need a title to be valuable.
- And I don’t need trauma to prove I was strong.

## ✅ Authentication Accepted

These days, my identity is patched together with less armor and more intention.

I'm not just the medic anymore.  
I'm a developer. A father. A husband. A man healing in plain sight.

And maybe most importantly:  
I’m not logging in to be someone else anymore.

I’m finally logging in as me.
