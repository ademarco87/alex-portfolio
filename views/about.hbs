    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I'm <strong>Alexander DeMarco</strong> — a veteran, a paramedic, a father of five, and a software developer built under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started my journey in the U.S. Army as a combat medic during the Global War on Terrorism. From treating trauma in sand-swept warzones to holding lives together in the back of an ambulance, I’ve spent over 16 years serving others in their worst moments.
    </p>

    <p>
      But trauma leaves weight. Burnout comes quietly. After nearly two decades of emergency medicine, I made the decision to step into something new — not to escape the past, but to grow beyond it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, I build software with the same grit I used to carry stretchers. I believe in clarity over chaos, in crafting systems that don’t break under pressure. My code is clean, my mission is focused, and my background gives me a perspective most developers don’t have.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t chase titles. I build value. I solve problems. And I’m just getting started.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resilience</strong> – Built through battlefields, refined through burnout</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – Chaos taught me to prioritize the signal over the noise</li>
      <li><strong>Discipline</strong> – From field dressings to full stack apps, I don’t cut corners</li>
      <li><strong>Authenticity</strong> – I’ve been through enough to skip the B.S.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're looking for a developer who knows how to perform under pressure, adapt without ego, and deliver with intensity — I’m already in your corner.
