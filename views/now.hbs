  <h2>💻 What I'm Working On</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fine-tuning this portfolio site while resisting the urge to burn it down and start over.</li>
    <li>Writing blogs that blend C++ rules with trauma unpacking. STR53-CPP changed me.</li>
    <li>Trying to remember half the shit I apparently already coded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 What I'm Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Still revisiting secure coding practices — turns out trauma doesn’t write clean C++.</li>
    <li>Learning more about Angular, JWT, and how to explain my projects without blacking out.</li>
    <li>Slowly building confidence that I’m not an impostor — just battle-tested.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 What I'm Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The weird vulnerability of publishing this site under my name.</li>
    <li>Accepting that healing means letting people see who I really am now — not who I used to be in uniform.</li>
    <li>That this career change isn’t just a new path. It’s a lifeline.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you're wondering what any of this means — <a href="/blog">read the blog</a>. It’s all there, unfiltered.</p>
